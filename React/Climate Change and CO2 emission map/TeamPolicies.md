    Demonstrate that you have read a message (by liking it or answering to it) and should be answered within 24 hours 

    We will communicate through Discord and try to mainly use GitLab with Issues, Checklist, Commits.  

    If someone doesn’t show up at the meeting, we can later message her/him how far we are, what have been completed or what she/he missed so the person can keep up the pace. 

    A teammate is unreachable, we will get in contact with them in person (for example at school). Otherwise, we will inform the teacher about it. 

    Important decisions, choices and works will be documented through meeting.md 

    Before deadlines, we will make sure that we have fulfilled the requirements and that we are on the same page. 

    For every merge request, one or both team members other than the one who did the merge request will do the code review and comments 

    If we have different opinions or views on a matter related to the project, we will talk about it and try to find an agreement. 

    If someone doesn’t want to talk about the issue or does not change their wrong behavior, we will see the teacher.

    In-Person: Monday theory class and lab + Thursday morning 8h30 – 10h
